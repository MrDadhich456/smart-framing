# Smart Farming System ðŸŒ¾

An **IoT-based Smart Farming System** designed to optimize irrigation and environmental monitoring. 
This project leverages sensors, automation, and mobile app control to improve farming efficiency, conserve water, 
and reduce manual labor.

## Features

- **Automated Irrigation**: A soil moisture sensor activates a water pump automatically based on real-time soil conditions.
- **Manual Control**: A light can be controlled manually via the **Blynk App**.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: The DHT11 sensor monitors temperature and humidity, with real-time data displayed on the app.
- **Remote Access**: Farmers can monitor and control the system through a mobile app.
- **Energy Efficient**: Supports integration with solar power for sustainable operation.
